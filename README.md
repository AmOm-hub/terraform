This Terraform code will create a VPC with public subnets in multiple availability zones, EC2 instances in the public subnets, a load balancer to distribute traffic across those instances, and security groups to control access to those resources.

To run this Terraform code, follow these steps:

Install the Terraform CLI and configure your AWS credentials.
Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the Terraform code.
Customize the variables in the variables.tf file as needed.
Initialize the working directory by running terraform init.
Preview the changes that Terraform will make by running terraform plan.
Apply the changes by running terraform apply.
After running terraform apply, Terraform will create the following resources:

A VPC with public subnets in multiple availability zones.
Two EC2 instances in the public subnets with the specified AMI and instance type.
A security group for the EC2 instances that allows SSH traffic from the specified IP address and HTTP traffic from the load balancer.
A security group for the load balancer that allows HTTP traffic from any IP address.
An Application Load Balancer that distributes traffic across the EC2 instances.
A target group that associates the EC2 instances with the load balancer.
You can clean up the resources by running terraform destroy in the same directory where you ran terraform apply.
